C cource files for the STM32F030F4

Theses use the StdLib in the CooCox IDE. The StdLib has been replaced by the HAL since this was made but the HAL has quite a sizable overhead so I will not port this to the HAL. ST has recently introduced a lighter LL library and I am working on porting this project to that under the free version of Atollic TrueSTUDIO as CooCox seems to have died as a development platform.
